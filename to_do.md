# TO DO

## Styling
- Navbar
- Homepage cards
- Darken vampire creation pages
- Thematic graphics
- Sidebar character sheet positioning

## Content
- Homepage text
- Instructions text on every creation page
- Text for help modal
- More prompts
- Inspiration page

## Gameplay
~~Proper prompt navigation: adding roll results to current prompt number to determine following prompt so that an endgame is reachable~~
- Per above, dice rolls to allow negative results that cause backwards prompt navigation
- Remove prompt number from local storage when user restarts game (i.e., when user goes back to start page then imports new character)
- Adding the additional entries to prompt pages in case same prompt is encountered again
- Prompt pages need accurate inputs/dropdowns for what the prompt dictates (i.e. selecting more than one skill in a dropdown)
- Page showing changes needs to be either reworked, deleted, or fixed to show correct additions/strike-throughs
- "Checking" a skill functionality (forgot what this means)

## App-wide
- A log or diary of the player's prompt answers
- Possible log-in feature so user has an account & doesn't need to import & export their character every time ("Continue")
